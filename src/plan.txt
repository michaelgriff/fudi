NOTE: 
Will have to add to the lambda and api gateway the functionality to 
get reviews based on the user that made them, that way when one user logs in, 
you will be able to scan all the reviews of people they follow. 

NOTE (Jan 26th): 
Probably makes sense to have page for each review showing the avergae score 
of all reviews and a list of all the reviews for it.

NOTE (Jan 26th): 
Need to find a way to display the profile thing better so that you can navigate 
to other peoples profiles without changing the base user state variable. Investigate 
the secondary path thing (ie: fudi.com/michaelgriff)

To do list: 
- enter on login button
- handling incorrect username/password
- signing up with same username
- editting existing reviews
- loading while requests are made
